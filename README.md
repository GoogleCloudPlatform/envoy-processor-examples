# Envoy Processor Examples

This repository contains a set of examples for Envoy's 
[External Processing Filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_proc_filter).

The python example is used in the [Service Extensions tutorials in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/configure-callout) docs.

The go example is for local host testing with a local Envoy.
